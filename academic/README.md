 -> NOTE: This was academic Project therefore is not supposed to provide advanced feature such that one could compare it to Apps in market,
          I know Current GUI is trash but i had very short period of time to learn & implement in college Lab Hours (External Upload was not)
          This was purely for Learning purpose with fun.
          -Database dump and php API files are provided in projects /jodidar/backend folder so you can set them up locally,
          -if you need to change the IP in android app or in Api request:
              Session.java & Connection.php has IP address variable ,you can modify them.
